# Installation and Use
If you don't have node.js, [install node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/). If you cannot use a package manager, binaries are [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Installing node will install npm. 

Yarn is not necessary but is preferred as a package manager over npm, because it should build project dependencies more consistently. [Installation notes are here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

1. `yarn` or `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
