# Installation
NOTE: Version 8.11.0 is required to run this app because of [an open issue with webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/6579). You can use [nvm](  https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) to install and switch between different versions of node.js. Because there are often breaking conflicts between versions of various packages in the node.js ecosystem, node.js version 8.11.0 specifically has been required so we can ensure the app will run.

1. `npm install` or `yarn`

# Start the app
## Dev
1. `npm start`
